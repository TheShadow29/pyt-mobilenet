# pyt-mobilenet
Pytorch Implementation of the MobileNet Architecture

# ToDoList:
  - [x] MobileNet v1
  - [x] MobileNet v2
  - [ ] Comparisons on CIFAR-10

## Acknowledgements:
Thanks to https://github.com/kuangliu/pytorch-cifar for his amazing repository and mobilenetv1 and mobilenetv2 implementations. Progress bar is implemented as I have wrapped around the fastai library. Exhaustive comparisons on cifar10 is remaining at the moment. Pre-trained models will be available soon.
